# Qoogle Chrome Extension
Quicker, keyboard-based google

## What it does
Use numbers 1-9 to select the first few search results, and browse beyond with up and down keys W and S. Perfect for when you have to look up an error message but you don't want to move your mouse at all.

## Installation
Download this repo. In Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`. Make sure developer mode is on in the top right corner. Click the button that says "Load unpacked" in the top left. Finally, find the folder on your computer.
